      "description": "Side channel testing involves assessing timing attack vectors, probing power consumption patterns, testing cache access patterns, evaluating memory usage analysis, testing network traffic patterns, probing GPU utilization signals, testing error message leakage, and evaluating resource allocation patterns. This aims to identify subtle data leakage or system compromise. Testing for training data inference can also fall under this category.",
